## Introduction <a id="introduction"> </a>
This mobile application is designed for pilots to help them manage their pre-flight checklists. The application allows pilots to login, search for a flight that they are the pilot for, and then complete a to-do list for that flight. The to-do list includes all of the tasks that the pilot needs to complete before the flight, such as checking the weather, loading the aircraft, and briefing the passengers.

The application also has a built-in warning system that will notify the pilot if they have not completed their to-do list 2 hours before the flight. If the pilot does not complete their to-do list within 1 hour before the flight, the application will log them as late in the database. This information can then be used by the pilot's managers to have a meeting with the pilot to discuss why they were late.
