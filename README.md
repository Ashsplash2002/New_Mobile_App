## Introduction <a id="introduction"> </a>
This mobile application is designed for pilots to help them manage their pre-flight checklists. The application allows pilots to login, search for a flight that they are the pilot for, and then complete a to-do list for that flight. The to-do list includes all of the tasks that the pilot needs to complete before the flight, such as checking the weather, loading the aircraft, and briefing the passengers.

The application also has a built-in warning system that will notify the pilot if they have not completed their to-do list 2 hours before the flight. If the pilot does not complete their to-do list within 1 hour before the flight, the application will log them as late in the database. This information can then be used by the pilot's managers to have a meeting with the pilot to discuss why they were late.

## Build Status <a id="build"> </a>
The mobile application is currently in the design phase. This means that we are still in the early stages of development and are working on the design of the application. We have not yet started coding the application, but we have a clear vision for what we want the application to do and how it should work.

Once the design is complete, we will begin coding the application. Once the coding is complete, we will move into the testing phase. We will test the application thoroughly to make sure that it is free of defects.

Once the application is tested and ready for release, we will move into the deployment phase. We will deploy the application to the app store and make it available to users.

We are excited about the development of this mobile application and believe that it will be a valuable tool for pilots. We are committed to developing a high-quality application that meets the needs of pilots. We will keep you updated on our progress as we move through the development phases
